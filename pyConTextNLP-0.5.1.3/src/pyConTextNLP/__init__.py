"""This is an alternative implementation of the pyConText package where I make
use of graphs to indicate relationships between targets and modifiers. Nodes of
thegraphs are the targets and modifiers identified in the text; edges of the
graphs are relationships between the targets. This provides for much simpler
code than what exists in the other version of pyConText where each object has a
dictionary of __modifies and __modifiedby that must be kept in sync with each
other.

Also it is hoped that the use of a directional graph could ultimately simplify
our itemData structures as we could chain together items"""
